## Skills

**Languages and Tools**
Learning with Makers has enabled me to become language agnostic - I am happy to work with new technologies and adapt as needed. Taking on new languages in a short space of time sharpened my problem solving and debugging skills.

**Continuous Development and Self-led Learning**
I continue to seek new information to enhance my personal and professional projects. Utilising Agile practices throughout Makers enabled me to focus on effective time management and prioritise tasks accordingly. For our final project, we challenged ourselves to learn Express and React in under 2 weeks to enhance our [Sneaker Seeker](https://github.com/InfobyAdrienne/Sneaker-Seeker-Demo) app.

**Attention to Detail**
When creating [Sneaker Seeker](https://github.com/InfobyAdrienne/Sneaker-Seeker-Demo), I was keen to implement clean design into our web app, especially considering the demographic of users.
