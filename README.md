## Skills

**Languages and Tools**
Learning with Makers has enabled me to become language agnostic - I am happy to work with new technologies and adapt as needed.
- **Languages** Experience with Ruby, JavaScript, basic Python, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks** Ruby on Rails, Express, Sinatra
- **Libraries** React
- **Databases** PostgrSQL, Postman, TablePlus
- **Tools** Git, Command Line, Miro, Trello
- **Testing** RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara
- **Design** Bootstrap, Figma, Material UI, Photoshop
- **Editing** Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X

**Continuous Development and Self-led Learning**
I continue to seek new information to enhance my personal and professional projects. I taught myself how to edit videos using industry standard software, which led to roles in the TV industry. Utilising Agile practices throughout Makers enabled me to focus on effective time management and prioritise tasks accordingly. For our final project, we challenged ourselves to learn Express and React in under 2 weeks to enhance our [Sneaker Seeker](https://github.com/InfobyAdrienne/Sneaker-Seeker-Demo) app.

**Problem Solving**
As a Production Assistant, I frequently sourced props and supplies on short deadlines and provided appropriate alternatives where necessary to aid production. This required a level of creativity and problem solving that is reflected in programming. Taking on new languages in a short space of time sharpened my problem solving and debugging skills.

**Leadership and Communication**
Throughout my education I have taken on various leadership roles, including Sport Officer and Prefect. This often involved delegating tasks, organising schedules, liaising with appropriate contacts and supporting the wellbeing of my team - which also involves giving feedback in pressured environments. During group projects, I was keen to encourage EQ practices amongst our team to manage stress and prevent burnout.

**Teamwork**
I enjoy playing team sports, particularly hockey, at various levels including County. I like to challenge myself to play in different positions to develop further understanding of the game from different perspectives. Additionally working through pair programming developed my communication skills.

**Attention to Detail**
As a researcher, I sought to find unique perspectives that increased engagement from viewers. Whilst working at a production company, I considered UX & UI design in order to create an engaging portfolio website. When creating [Sneaker Seeker](https://github.com/InfobyAdrienne/Sneaker-Seeker-Demo), I was keen to implement clean design into our web app, especially considering the demographic of users.
